# Minesweeper - My First Contact with Computer Science

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game. I created this code a while back, during my initial contact with computer science, while taking the introductory module of Harvard's CS50.

## Description

This code demonstrates the core logic of a Minesweeper game:

*   Generating a game board with hidden cells.
*   Randomly placing bombs on the board.
*   Calculating the number of neighboring bombs for each cell.
*   Revealing the content of a cell when the player "flips" it.

While basic, this project reflects my early understanding of programming concepts and algorithmic thinking. It was a great learning experience that introduced me to the fundamental concepts of:

*   Data Structures (using 2D arrays)
*   Algorithms (generating a minefield and calculating neighbor bombs)
*   Code Organization (using functions for different functionalities)

## How to Use

1.  **Run the code**: You can run the file from your terminal, using node or any javascript engine.
    ```bash
        node your_file_name.js
    ```
    *Replace `your_file_name.js` with the name you gave your javascript file*

2.  **Interact with the code**: The script will print a player board and a bomb board to the console. You can also "flip" a tile, changing the player board, to see how it works.

## Important Notes

*   This code has no user interface, and itâ€™s designed to run on the console.
*   This code isn't a finished game, so you can't actually "win" or "lose" a game. It's more of a demonstration of the core game logic.
*   This code was written a few years ago, reflecting my early coding skills. I'm sharing it here to showcase my learning process.
